Before the file could hit R, I went in with a text editor and manually removed all the doublequotes from the file as the file was not going through read.table properly.  Find-replace'd all \"s with nothing (not even a space) given that there were over 300,000 double quotes, I suppose it isn't all that unlikely for a data entry error to crop up.
